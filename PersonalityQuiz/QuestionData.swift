While you may not shine in conflict, you certainly take the cake when it comes to finding a new solution. Devious and shrewd, you'll get your way, even if its through someone elses moves"

But you're braver than anyone, an inspiration to those who would follow, and loyal to your home. While not always sucessfuly you're a dangerous opponent to underestimate, you won't give them an inch without a fight. Perhaps you won't succeed but you stand as hero for the ages unquestioned in bravery"
